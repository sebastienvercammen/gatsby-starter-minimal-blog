A short article about Node.js, [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv), how your application might be bottlenecked by libuv, and how to fix it.

## Potential Impact

For I/O-heavy applications that rely on libuv, the libuv thread pool size may become a critical bottleneck and one of the most impactful factors to increase total throughput.

## "What's a libuv?"

[libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) is a multi-platform library for asynchronous I/O.

## Must-Know about libuv?

* Some of Node.js' I/O methods rely on libuv.
    * Where possible, Node.js uses APIs that are already asynchronous/non-blocking.
    * In the other cases, libuv uses a thread pool to turn sync/blocking I/O into async/non-blocking.
* libuv's thread pool size is only `4` by default.

## What's the Problem?

In as few words as possible: libuv's default thread pool size is only `4`.

Do anything more than 4 concurrent I/O operations that rely on libuv, and libuv's small thread pool size becomes a bottleneck, as each extra operation has to wait in queue.

Some I/O operations that use libuv's thread pool:

* All file system operations
* DNS resolution
* Lib & user code that calls uv_queue_work

## Solving It

To solve it, increase the environment variable `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` **before** you do any I/O calls. Ideally, change it before starting Node.js.

libuv instantiates the thread pool when you first call an I/O method that relies on the thread pool. Once instantiated, changes to the thread pool size (`UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE`) will have no effect.

### Examples

It's recommended to change `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` before starting Node.js.

Your intentions are clearer if you set environment variables before launching Node.js, and it's less likely that something will go wrong _(e.g. an included library calls I/O as a side effect)_.

**Via Bash:**
```bash
UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=64 node index.js
```

**Via Windows CLI:**
```bat
SET UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=64 && node index.js
```

**As first instruction in your Node.js app:** _(not recommended)_
```js
'use strict'
process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=64;
```

## How High Should I Set It?

Depends on a case-by-case basis.

* The thread pool size is the exact amount of **maximum** concurrent I/O tasks.
* Setting it a little too high has less impact on your throughput than setting it too low.
* Setting it extremely high is unnecessary.
* Memory overhead is ~1MB for 128 threads.
* The maximum (since 1.30.0) is `1024`.
* Setting it to the number of CPU cores is not a good standard. These are I/O, not CPU-intensive, operations.

You can count threads in use by `node` on Linux with:

```bash
ps -Lef | grep  "\<node\>" | wc -l
```
